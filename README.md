Sensor Based Mobile Applications

Make sure you have the latest version of android studio

There are no api keys that need to be generated nor are there any external devices that can be connected.

App installation is as easy as importing from version control. Just make sure to allow all permissions. 

Denying perms twice is marked as never ask again, if you want to reset the perms go to (on your phone) settings -> search -> apps -> SportsTrackerApp -> permissions and select the permissions and click allow. Alternatively you can go to SportsTrackerApp -> Storage -> cleare cache & clear data. However this will remove all data from the app, including any saved data.
